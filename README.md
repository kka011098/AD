# Anomaly Detection

Currently implementing: iterative DBSCAN, K-Means, Isolation forests, one class SVM + voting.

To improve: Add PCA; autoencoder based training and detection (mini baler); improve iterative selection; connect to baler to check the compressed outputs in realtime (far-fetched goal)
